I am not ignoring the risk of sounding too vague and unfocused, but depending on what needs to get done I play the part of following roles:

  * An Employee
  * A Project Manager
  * A Professional Technical Communicator
  * A Business Analyst
  * A wannabe Marketing Writer
  * A former Entrepreneur
  * Hopefully an Entrepreneur again in the future
  * And a few more I think

In addition on a personal level I play the roles of:

  * Father
  * Son
  * Husband
  * Friend
  * Mentor / Guide

I hold a Master's degree in Automotive Engineering and bachelor's degree in Automobile Engineering, but having said that I haven't worked a day in the Automotive industry.

I currently working as a IT Analyst and a Project Manager. Project Management is a fascinating role and really challenges ones people skills to the limit. 

I try to write as frequently as I can. You can find my writings on this website, and I also write on <a title="My LinkedIn Profile. " href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sundarnadimpalli" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
