I am not ignoring the risk of sounding too vague and unfocused, but depending on what needs to get done I play the part of following roles:

  * An Employee
  * A Professional Technical Writer
  * A Business Analyst
  * A wannabe Marketing Writer
  * A former Entrepreneur
  * Hopefully an Entrepreneur again in the future
  * And a few more I think

In addition on a personal level I play the roles of:

  * Father
  * Son
  * Husband

I hold a Master's degree in Automotive Engineering and bachelor's degree in Automobile Engineering, but having said that I haven't worked a day in the Automotive industry.

I currently work at Indian office of <a title="My Current Employer" href="http://www.altair-india.in/" target="_blank">Altair Engineering</a> as  Technical Writer. I am responsible for creating and maintaining the documentation for the Packaged Solution Offerings that are produced by the Enterprise Solutions Group at Altair. As a technical writer I am interested in producing technical help content that is useful to users. And believe that documentation can no longer be just text anymore. It needs to be delivered to users to multiple media formats.

I try to write as frequently as I can. You can find my writings on this website, and on the <a title="The TechWritingExperts Blog." href="http://www.techwritingexperts.co/blog/blogger/listings/sundarn" target="_blank">TechWritingExperts.co</a> website. I also write on <a title="My LinkedIn Profile. " href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sundarnadimpalli" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
