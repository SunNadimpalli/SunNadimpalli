Yesterday, I attended a workshop about User Centered Design and Documentation organized by the Bangalore STC India Chapter and Microfocus/Novell. Here is a summary of the workshop. 

## The Place and Context

The Workshop was conducted at the Bangalore office of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.novell.com/home/">Micro Focus (Formerly Novell)</a>. It was a four and half hour workshop. Went from 10 AM to 2.30 PM. The workshop was conducted by a cross functional team that works at Novell. The team was made up of Graphic Design Professionals, Usability Testers and Technical Writers. This team works on the product [NetIQ Sentinel](https://www.netiq.com/products/sentinel/) among others.

The audience was primarily madeup of Technical Writers from companies like Cisco, TCS, Altair and many others. The workshop was conducted in a cozy training room at the Novell office. 

## The Agenda

The workshop came about when the folks at Novell expressed their desire to conduct this workshop to Rajdeep Gupta (who represents the Bangalore STC India Chapter). Although it was the first time I attended any workshop conducted by Novell, I heard that they have conducted a few other workshops earlier on Usability Testing. 

### The Introduction

The workshop was kickstarted by Parag Goel, who established the context by tell us about Novell, Micro Focus, the UCD initiatives at Novell and also introduced the team who would be running the workshop.
