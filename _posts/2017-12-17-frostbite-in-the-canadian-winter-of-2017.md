All I want for Christmas and everyday before and after is to be able to walk in the Toronto winter (and later spring, summer and fall too) in my brand new [Prio](https://xeroshoes.com/shop/activity/performance/prio-men/) shoes made by XeroShoes. 

It is late evening and -8 deg C outside as I write this. Earlier during the day the temperatures were a not-too-bad -4 or so. I had gone out and might have been out walking on the snow covered side-walks for no longer than 15 to 20 minutes. I was on my feet for about an hour or so walking inside a mall. I enjoyed being in my Prios the whole time that I was in them.  

I got the Prio about a week or so back by Canada Post. My biggest worry was if I would be able to wear them outside in the early Canadian winter temperatures. I am happy to note that I can enjoy walking in the Prio in the winter and snow. 

Okay, may be I am celebrating too early. This is still early winter and colder months of January and February are still ahead of me. May be I will not be able to handle the colder temperatures of -20 deg C or -40 deg C in these shoes. 

There was a day last week where I had to walk for about 40 minutes or so in 4 inch deep snow. I was wearing my Prio shoes and a not so thick socks. The first 15 minutes were ok, I did not feel any discomfort but at about 20 minutes I felt pin prick of pain at the tips of my toes. The pain continued all the way back until I was back home. That is the first time ever in my life that I experienced that so I am assuming that it was because my feet got too cold for comfort. 

The next day I went out and bought a pair of thick thermal socks from a Canadian Tire store. They day I wore the Prio with the thick thermal socks my feet felt fine. And then another day I was out walking in over side walks covered in about an inch of snow wearing two pairs of socks inside my Prio. I felt no discomfort being out in the cold for more than 30 minutes. 

I am happy to make a note to self that I can continue to enjoy walking in minimalist footwear during the Canadian winter and not be worrying about a frostbite. But like I said, it may be too early to conclude this and I will write another note in a month or two.

Sort of Unrelated Trivia: In the month or so that I have been in Canada I have not come across anyone wearing a Prio.
