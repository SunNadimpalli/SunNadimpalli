I wanted to build a static website for a new website to host stories that I have wanting to write from a long time. I spent a long time thinking about what to use to build the story website. I considered a lot of options: Wordpress, Joomla, a custom PHP based website to help with reusable components (for headers, footers, menus, etc). After thinking about it for a while and also after a lot of Googling I felt pulled towards using a static site generator. 

This website uses [Jekyll and Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/), but I wanted to learn something new so that I can satisfy my craving for learning something new and end up with this new website that I needed for the stories. And so, [Stories by Sundar](http://stories.sundarnadimpalli.com) ended up bring built using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/). _Thank you to the Pelican Team_.

I really enjoyed using Pelican for building the site and what made the whole process even more easy that a tutorial by [Peter Kazarinoff](http://pythonforundergradengineers.com/pages/about.html). You can see more about this work here: [@professorkazarinoff](https://github.com/professorkazarinoff).

Peter's details tutorial had everything that I needed for my website and so I shamelessly followed his tutorial to build my website. _Thank you Peter_.
