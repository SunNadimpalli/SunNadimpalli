### My Resume Sucks and I Hate It

I hate writing and re-writing my resume. The reason I hate it is because most of the times I have written my resume, it doesn&#8217;t sound like me. My starting point for writing my resume has always been a great looking template that I found on the net, or the resume of a friend.

Is there a better way for me write about my career history, qualifications, skill set that is valuable to a hiring manager, than the boring cookie cutter format that is indistinguishable from everyone else&#8217;s resume.

## The Human-Voiced Resume

While I was wallowing in these feelings, I came across a refreshing article by **<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/" target="_blank">Liz Ryan</a>**, called **<a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2014/07/17/how-to-write-your-human-voiced-resume/">How To Write Your Human-Voiced Resume</a>**.
